The mods are in the order you check them. When "Start Server" is clicked, it generates config.json where you can fine tune mods order if you like

# How To Use
1. Set your DayzServer_x64.exe path.<br>
2. Set your mods directory, for example workshop folder that holds all dayz mods.<br>
3. Choose all the mods you wan't in your server from listbox below. There should be list of mods after mods directory was set.<br><br>

When "Start Server" is clicked, it generates config.json where you can fine tune mods order and launchparameters if you like<br>

## NOTE
This copies all the mods you selected from the listbox, to your Dayz Server folder.<br>
This copies also all the keys from individual mod to the DayzServer/Keys folder automatically.
